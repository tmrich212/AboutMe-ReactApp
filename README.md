# AboutMe-ReactApp
My first React App, using my knowledge of components, useState, and click events so far to give some insight into who I am and how I became interested in becoming a developer. This was built about half way through a React course as practice to apply the things I have learned so far. As I continue to go through my React course I may add on to this project!
